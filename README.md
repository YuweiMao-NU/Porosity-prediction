# A deep learning framework for layer-wise porosity prediction
This repository contains the code for A deep learning framework for layer-wise porosity prediction in metal powder bed fusion using thermal signatures. The code provides the following functions:

- detection module to detect porosity using thermal signatures
- prediction module to predict future layer's porosity using previous layers' history information.

## Installation Requirements
The basic requirement for using the files is a Python 3.8.19 environment with PyTorch 2.3.0

## Source Files
Here is a brief description of the files and folder content:

- detection_module.py: to detect porosity labels using thermal signatures.
- prediction_module.py: to predict future layer's porosity labels using previous layers' history information.

## Running the code
To generate the dataset, run detection_module.py file to detect porosity labels first. Next, run prediction_module.py to predict future layer's porosity labels using previous layers' history information.

## Developer Team
The code was developed by Yuwei Mao from the [CUCIS](http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/) group at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northwestern University.
